# Surgical Videos

This directory should contain surgical video files for training and testing.

Due to file size constraints on GitHub, the actual video files have been excluded.

## Expected Files
- Various `.mp4` files
- `.ts` files with surgical footage

## Video Data
The video data can be obtained by:
1. Using publicly available datasets like Cholec80
2. Requesting access to the specific videos used in our research
3. Using your own surgical footage (please ensure proper anonymization and consent)
