# SurgicalAI Training Setup Complete

## What's Been Accomplished

1. **Project Organization for Colab Training**
   - Created all necessary directories for organized training
   - Created template annotation files
   - Set up .gitignore to exclude large files from GitHub
   - Prepared a comprehensive Colab notebook with all training code

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Copied training images for tool detection (~1778 images)
   - Extracted 265 frames from the laparoscopic cholecystectomy video
   - Created template phase and tool annotations

3. **Training Infrastructure**
   - Modified training scripts to support mixed precision training
   - Added Colab-specific optimizations for better performance
   - Created a model loading script for bringing trained models back to the local environment

## Training Data Status

| Component | Data Status | Availability |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Tool Detection | 1778 images extracted | ✅ Ready for annotation |
| Phase Recognition | 265 frames extracted | ✅ Ready for annotation |
| Mistake Detection | Using existing mistake_annotations.json | ✅ Available but may need updates |

## What's Next

### 1. Complete Annotations
- Complete tool annotations in the COCO format
- Organize phase frames into appropriate directories
- Verify mistake annotations match the available video frames

### 2. Push to GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for SurgicalAI with Colab training setup"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SurgicalAI.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Train on Google Colab
- Open the notebook in Google Colab
- Mount your Google Drive
- Clone your GitHub repository
- Upload or copy your data
- Run the training cells
- Save the trained models to Google Drive

### 4. Use Trained Models Locally
```bash
# Download models from Google Drive to your local machine
python scripts/load_trained_models.py --source_dir path/to/downloaded/models
```

## Training Time Estimates (on Google Colab T4 GPU)

| Model | Time Estimate | Memory Requirements |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| Tool Detection | 2-3 hours | 8-10 GB GPU |
| Phase Recognition | 1-2 hours | 6-8 GB GPU |
| Mistake Detection | ~1 hour | 4-6 GB GPU |

## Files Created for Colab Training

1. `colab_training/SurgicalAI_Training.ipynb` - The main Colab notebook
2. `colab_training/README.md` - Detailed instructions for training
3. `scripts/prepare_for_training.py` - Setup script for the project
4. `scripts/extract_frames.py` - Tool to extract frames from videos
5. `scripts/load_trained_models.py` - Tool to load trained models into the project

## Useful Commands

### Extract Video Frames with Phase Organization
```bash
python scripts/extract_frames.py --video_path "data/videos/Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy High Definition Full Length Video.mp4" --output_dir data/phases --fps 1 --annotations data/annotations/phase_annotations.json --organize_by_phase
```

### Prepare Project for Training
```bash
python scripts/prepare_for_training.py
```

### Load Trained Models
```bash
python scripts/load_trained_models.py --source_dir path/to/downloaded/models
```
