# SurgicalAI Training Setup Complete

## What's Been Accomplished

1. **Project Organization for Colab Training**
   - Created all necessary directories for organized training
   - Created template annotation files
   - Set up .gitignore to exclude large files from GitHub
   - Prepared a comprehensive Colab notebook with all training code

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Copied training images for tool detection (~1778 images)
   - Extracted 265 frames from the laparoscopic cholecystectomy video
   - Created template phase and tool annotations

3. **Training Infrastructure**
   - Modified training scripts to support mixed precision training
   - Added Colab-specific optimizations for better performance
   - Created a model loading script for bringing trained models back to the local environment

## Training Data Status

| Component | Data Status | Availability |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Tool Detection | 1778 images extracted | ✅ Ready for annotation |
| Phase Recognition | 265 frames extracted | ✅ Ready for annotation |
| Mistake Detection | Using existing mistake_annotations.json | ✅ Available but may need updates |

## What's Next

### 1. Complete Annotations
- Complete tool annotations in the COCO format
- Organize phase frames into appropriate directories
- Verify mistake annotations match the available video frames

### 2. Push to GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for SurgicalAI with Colab training setup"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SurgicalAI.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Train on Google Colab
- Open the notebook in Google Colab
- Mount your Google Drive
- Clone your GitHub repository
- Upload or copy your data
- Run the training cells
- Save the trained models to Google Drive

### 4. Use Trained Models Locally
```bash
# Download models from Google Drive to your local machine
python scripts/load_trained_models.py --source_dir path/to/downloaded/models
```

## Training Time Estimates (on Google Colab T4 GPU)

| Model | Time Estimate | Memory Requirements |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| Tool Detection | 2-3 hours | 8-10 GB GPU |
| Phase Recognition | 1-2 hours | 6-8 GB GPU |
| Mistake Detection | ~1 hour | 4-6 GB GPU |

## Files Created for Colab Training

1. `colab_training/SurgicalAI_Training.ipynb` - The main Colab notebook
2. `colab_training/README.md` - Detailed instructions for training
3. `scripts/prepare_for_training.py` - Setup script for the project
4. `scripts/extract_frames.py` - Tool to extract frames from videos
5. `scripts/load_trained_models.py` - Tool to load trained models into the project

## Useful Commands

### Extract Video Frames with Phase Organization
```bash
python scripts/extract_frames.py --video_path "data/videos/Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy High Definition Full Length Video.mp4" --output_dir data/phases --fps 1 --annotations data/annotations/phase_annotations.json --organize_by_phase
```

### Prepare Project for Training
```bash
python scripts/prepare_for_training.py
```

### Load Trained Models
```bash
python scripts/load_trained_models.py --source_dir path/to/downloaded/models
```

# SurgicalAI Colab Training: Fixed Setup

## Problem Identified

The error messages in your Colab training indicate path issues:

```
python3: can't open file '/content/training/train_tool_detection.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

This happens because the Colab training script expects training files to be in specific locations, but they aren't being correctly set up.

## Solution

The issue can be fixed by creating a proper directory structure and copying/linking files correctly. Here's how:

### 1. Create the Fix Script

Create a file named `fix_colab_paths.py` with the following content:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import shutil
import sys

def create_directory(path):
    if not os.path.exists(path):
        os.makedirs(path, exist_ok=True)
        print(f"Created directory: {path}")

def main():
    print("Fixing paths for SurgicalAI training in Colab...")
    
    # Create required directories
    create_directory("/content/training")
    create_directory("/content/models/weights/tool_detection")
    create_directory("/content/models/weights/vit_lstm")
    create_directory("/content/models/weights/mistake_detector")
    
    # Copy training scripts to the expected locations
    training_files = [
        "train_tool_detection.py",
        "train_phase_recognition.py",
        "train_all_models.py"
    ]
    
    for file in training_files:
        source = f"/content/SurgicalAI_clone/training/{file}"
        target = f"/content/training/{file}"
        
        if os.path.exists(source):
            shutil.copy2(source, target)
            print(f"Copied {source} to {target}")
        else:
            print(f"Warning: Source file {source} not found!")
    
    # Create symbolic links for models directory
    if not os.path.exists("/content/models"):
        if os.path.exists("/content/SurgicalAI_clone/models"):
            os.symlink("/content/SurgicalAI_clone/models", "/content/models")
            print("Created symbolic link for models directory")
        else:
            print("Warning: models directory not found in SurgicalAI_clone!")
    
    # Create symbolic links for other necessary directories
    for directory in ["data", "utils", "config"]:
        if not os.path.exists(f"/content/{directory}"):
            if os.path.exists(f"/content/SurgicalAI_clone/{directory}"):
                os.symlink(f"/content/SurgicalAI_clone/{directory}", f"/content/{directory}")
                print(f"Created symbolic link for {directory} directory")
            else:
                print(f"Warning: {directory} directory not found in SurgicalAI_clone!")
    
    print("Path fixing completed! You can now run the training scripts.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### 2. Use this Workflow in Colab

1. Mount Google Drive
2. Clone your repository as `SurgicalAI_clone`
3. Run the fix script
4. Change to the root directory 
5. Run training commands from `/content` directory

### 3. Single Code Block Solution

For convenience, we've provided a single code block in `single_code_block_fix.md` that you can copy into a Colab cell to perform all these steps.

## Updated Workflow

```
1. Mount Drive -> 2. Clone Repo -> 3. Fix Paths -> 4. Run Training -> 5. Save Models
```

The updated workflow handles these critical steps:
- Creates symbolic links to needed directories
- Copies training scripts to expected locations
- Ensures model output directories exist
- Properly saves trained models to Google Drive

## Verification

After running the fix, you can verify success by:
1. Checking that `/content/training/` contains all three training Python files
2. Confirming that symbolic links exist for data, models, config and utils
3. Successfully running training commands from `/content` directory

This solution ensures your SurgicalAI training runs correctly in the Colab environment.
