# Tool Detection Models

This directory should contain model weight files for the tool detection model.

Due to file size constraints on GitHub, the actual model weight files have been excluded.

## Expected Files
- `tool_detection.pth` (approximately 160MB)

## Obtaining Model Weights
The model weights can be obtained by:
1. Training the model using the provided scripts
2. Requesting access to pre-trained weights from the authors
3. Downloading from our dedicated model repository (coming soon)
